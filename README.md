# Linux pranks

## How to use

Choose the prank you want to from this list: 
* `./mouse.sh`: This script will install a cronjob which will move the mouse to random position every minute.
* `./path.sh ["/path/to/command"]`: This script will create a new folder, create files from a list of the most used command. All these files will execute the command you set as $1 (default: /sbin/reboot).
* `./screen.sh`: This script will invert the screen of the student.
* `./speak.sh ["lock your pc"]`: This script will install a cronjob which will say the $1 (default "hello $USER").
* `./urandom.sh`: This script will add a line at the end of .bashrc that will display random characters each time student opens his terminal.

### You are free to contribute to these pranks by submitting ideas or the pranks directly.
